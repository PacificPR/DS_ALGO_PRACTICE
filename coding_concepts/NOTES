We have to find middle elements in many questions.
EG : Binary Search 

So we use int mid = (low + high)/2 , generally

But it's not a good practice as it can lead to integer overflow for large value of low and high

$$ So we should use,  
                
          int mid = low + (high-low)/2;

It avoids integer overflow , cool xD
