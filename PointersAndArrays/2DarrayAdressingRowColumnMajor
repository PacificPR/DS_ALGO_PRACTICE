###ROW MAJOR FOR 2D ARRAYS :

Row Major System:

The address of a location in Row Major System is calculated using the following
formula:

Address of A[i][J] = B + (W * [N*(i–Lr)+(j–Lc)])
FOR arrays in C/C++,with 0 as starting address, A[i][J] = B + (W *[N*(I)+(J)])

Column Major System:

The address of a location in Column Major System is calculated using the
following formula:

Address of              A[i][j]  = B+W*[(i–Lr)+M*(j–Lc)]
 FOR arrays in C/C++,with 0 as starting address, A[i][j]=B+W*[(i–Lr)+M*(j–Lc)]

Where,
B = Base address
i = Row subscript of element whose address is to be found
j = Column subscript of element whose address is to be found
W = Storage Size of one element stored in the array (in byte)
Lr = Lower limit of row/start row index of matrix, if not given assume 0 (zero)
Lc = Lower limit of column/start column index of matrix, if not given assume 0
(zero)
M = Number of row of the given matrix
N = Number of column of the given matrix
