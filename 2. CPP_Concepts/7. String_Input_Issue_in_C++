Problem :
Suppose the input format is

Integer\n
One line of string input\n
Integer\n

… And so on.
Then when you scan integer using cin or scanf then it will scan the integer till it reads “\n” or " " ( blank space)
Issue will be there when there is one \n char after integer.
And it will stop before “\n”
Now when you try to read using getline you will get blank string in input because getline will directly get “\n” in input and it will stop reading.

Whereas getline will also scan till it reads “\n”
And will stop after \n.

Solution :
Add extra getline/getchar whenever it’s required according to input format and it will start working as you want it to.

Now that you understand the actual issue, you can easily resolve it by putting extra getline(); whenever required.
Just remember where will you have extra newline chars in input
