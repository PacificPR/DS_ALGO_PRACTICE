                                        ****************** Forward List in C++  **********************

Forward list in STL implements singly linked list. Introduced from C++11, forward list are useful than other containers in insertion, removal and moving operations (like sort)
and allows time constant insertion and removal of elements. 

The drawback of forward list is that it cannot be iterated backwards and its individual elements cannot be accessed directly.

Forward List is preferred over list when only forward traversal is required (same as singly linked list is preferred over doubly linked list) as we can save space. 
Some example cases are, chaining in hashing, adjacency list representation of graph, etc.

*********** OPERATIONS ON FORWARD_LIST :

1. assign() :- This function is used to assign values to forward list, its another variant is used to assign repeated elements. 

2. push_front() :- This function is used to insert the element at the first position on forward list. 
                   The value from this function is copied to the space before first element in the container.
                   The size of forward list increases by 1.

3. emplace_front() :- This function is similar to the previous function but in this no copying operation occurs, 
                    the element is created directly at the memory before the first element of the forward list.

4. pop_front() :- This function is used to delete the first element of list. 

4. insert_after() This function gives us a choice to insert elements at any position in forward list. The arguments in this function are copied at the desired position.

5. emplace_after() This function also does the same operation as above function but the elements are directly made without any copy operation.

6. erase_after() This function is used to erase elements from a particular position in the forward list.

7. remove() :- This function removes the particular element from the forward list mentioned in its argument.

8. remove_if() :- This function removes according to the condition in its argument.

9. splice_after() :- This function transfers elements from one forward list to other. 

****************** IMPORTANT

1. merge() :- This function is used to merge one forward list with other. If both the lists are sorted then the resulted list returned is also sorted.

2. operator “=” :- This operator copies one forward list into other. The copy made in this case is deep copy.

3. sort() :- This function is used to sort the forward list.

4. unique() :- This function deletes the multiple occurrences of a number and returns a forward list with unique elements. The forward list should be sorted for this function to execute successfully.

5. reverse() :- This function is used to reverse the forward list.

6. swap() :- This function swaps the content of one forward list with other.

7. clear() :- This function clears the contents of forward list. After this function, the forward list becomes empty.

8. empty() :- This function returns true if the list is empty otherwise false.
