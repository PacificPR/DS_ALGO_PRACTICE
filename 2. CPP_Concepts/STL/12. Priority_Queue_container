                *************** Priority Queue in C++ Standard Template Library (STL) **********************

Priority queues are a type of container adapters, specifically designed such that the first element of the queue is the greatest of all elements in the queue 
and elements are in non increasing order(hence we can see that each element of the queue has a priority{fixed order}).
