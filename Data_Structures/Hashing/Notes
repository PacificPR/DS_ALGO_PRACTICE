An instance of HashMap has two parameters that affect its performance: initial capacity and load factor.
The capacity is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial capacity is simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created. 

Load Factor
The Load factor is a measure that decides when to increase the HashMap capacity to maintain the get() and put() operation complexity of O(1).
The default load factor of HashMap is 0.75f (75% of the map size).



If you want to keep get and put complexity O(1), it is advisable to have a load factor around 0.75.

####  Correlation between performance , hash collision & loading factor ?
Lower load factor = more free buckets = less chances of collision = high performance = high space requirement.
