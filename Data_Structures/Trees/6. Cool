The following three are known to be the preorder, inorder and postorder sequences of a binary tree. But it is not known which is which.
MBCAFHPYK
KAMCBYPFH
MABCKYFPH
Pick the true statement from the following.

A   I and II are preorder and inorder sequences, respectively
B   I and III are preorder and postorder sequences, respectively
C   II is the inorder sequence, but nothing more can be said about the other two sequences
D   II and III are the preorder and inorder sequences, respectively


ANS : D
Explanation


The approach to solve this question is to first find 2 sequences whose first and last element is same. The reason being first element in the Pre-order of any binary tree is the root and last element in the Post-order of any binary tree is the root.
Looking at the sequences given,
Pre-order   =   KAMCBYPFH
Post-order  =  MBCAFHPYK
Left-over sequence  MABCKYFPH will be in order.
