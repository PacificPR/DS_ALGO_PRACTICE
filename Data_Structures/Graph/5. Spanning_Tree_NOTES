A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges. 
Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected..

By this definition, we can draw a conclusion that every connected and undirected Graph G has at least one spanning tree. 
A disconnected graph does not have any spanning tree, as it cannot be spanned to all its vertices.

Mathematical Properties of Spanning Tree

    Spanning tree has n-1 edges, where n is the number of nodes (vertices).

    From a complete graph, by removing maximum e - n + 1 edges, we can
    construct a spanning tree. As, (n-1) edges are required for spanning trees.

    A complete graph can have maximum n^(n-2) number of spanning trees.



                ##################### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) ##################

In a weighted graph, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree that has minimum weight than all other spanning trees of the same graph. In real-world situations, this weight can be measured as distance, congestion, traffic load or any arbitrary value denoted to the edges.
Minimum Spanning-Tree Algorithm

We shall learn about two most important spanning tree algorithms here âˆ’

    Kruskal's Algorithm

    Prim's Algorithm

Both are greedy algorithms.
