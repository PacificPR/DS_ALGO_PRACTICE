/*
#####   Kahnâ€™s algorithm for Topological Sorting

Algorithm: Steps involved in finding the topological ordering of a DAG:
Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)

Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.
        A. Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
        B. Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
        C. If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.

Step 4: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.

Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph then the topological sort is not possible for the given graph.

#### Complexity Analysis:

$$$$$ Time Complexity: O(V+E).
The outer for loop will be executed V number of times and the inner for loop will be executed E number of times.

$$$$$ Auxillary Space: O(V).
The queue needs to store all the vertices of the graph. So the space required is O(V)
